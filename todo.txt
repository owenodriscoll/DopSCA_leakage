What happens when backscatter along track is correlated through air-sea phenomena?
Will the Doppler cancel out like when a normal distribution of scattering is considered?


Quantify additional Doppler uncertainty as a result of this interaction between:
    - geometry doppler, beam pattern and surface patterns 
    - with chirp duration of 2 ms (1 ms --> ~7m along track between pulse pair cross corr. peak)

QUESTIONS:
    - Is phase difference between pulse pair used to derive geophysical Doppler?
    - How is received Doppler spectrum converted to single phase?
    - What is the Temporal (and along track) seperation between aft and fore beam of 

TO DO:
    - Find more realistic beam pattern
    - Find error margins in geometrical Doppler 
        - If there is tiny error margin in geometrical Doppler it might exceed small geophysical Doppler
    - Find how to represent variations w.r.t. average  wind-wave interaction fields as wave spectrum
    - Find if DopRIM can represent these varying wave fields
    - How to infer Doppler field of unstable fields (or any field with large structures) 


TO DO code:
    - Include non-rectilinear geometry
    - Include earth's rotation


IDEAS:
- Use CDOP to convert backscatter fields to Doppler to estimate distribution of doppler from range of scenes
