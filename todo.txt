in 1D along track
- Model antenna pattern (like a weighting function)
- Calculate geometrical Doppler for beam footprint
- Calculate geophysical Doppler (DopRIM)

What happens when backscatter along track is correlated through air-sea phenomena?
Will the Doppler cancel out like when a normal distribution of scattering is considered?


Quantify additional Doppler uncertainty as a result of this interaction between:
    - geometry doppler, beam pattern and surface patterns 



TO DO:
    - Find more realistic beam pattern
    - Find error margins in geometrical Doppler 
        - If there is 5% error it might exceed geophysical signal
    - Find how to represent variations w.r.t. average  wind-wave interaction fields as wave spectrum
    - Find if DopRIM can represent these varying wave fields
    - How to infer Doppler field of unstable fields (or any field with large structures) 


TO DO code:
    - Include non-rectilinear geometry
    - Include earth's rotation


IDEAS:
- Use CDOP to convert backscatter fields to Doppler to estimate distribution of doppler from range of scenes
