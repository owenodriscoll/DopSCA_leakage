in 1D along track
- Model antenna pattern (like a weighting function)
- Calculate geometrical Doppler for beam footprint (satellite and Earth motion)
    - Doppler centroid with zero-Doppler exactly down slant range
    - Doppler of angle within beam 

What happens when backscatter along track is correlated through air-sea phenomena?
Will the Doppler cancel out like when a normal distribution of scattering is considered?

Move to 2D?

Quantify additional Doppler uncertainty as a result of this interaction between:
    - geometry doppler, beam pattern and surface patterns
